# Weekly Salary

<span style={{ fontSize: "1.25em" }}>
Write a function that takes a list of hours and returns the total weekly salary.
The input list hours is listed sequentially, ordered from Monday to Sunday.
A worker earns $10 an hour for the first 8 hours.
For every overtime hour, he earns $15.
On weekends, the employer pays double the usual rate, regardless how many hours were worked previously that week. For instance, 10 hours worked on a weekday would pay 80+30 = $110, but on a weekend it would pay 160+60 = $220.
