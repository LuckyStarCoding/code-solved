**Complexity:** 🚀 Time: O(1) | 💾 Space: O(1)

This solution demonstrates a functional approach by breaking down payroll rules into modular helper functions. This makes the logic easy to test and verify for each specific pay scenario.

## 📝 Task Description
Write a function that takes a list of hours (Monday to Sunday) and returns the total weekly salary based on these rules:
- **Standard Rate:** 10 per hour for the first 8 hours.
- **Overtime Rate:** 15 per hour for hours beyond 8.
- **Weekends:** Employer pays double the usual rate for all hours.

    | Input (Mon - Sun) | Output | Reasoning |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]` | `400` | 5 days * 80 = 400 |
    | `[10, 10, 10, 0, 8, 0, 0]` | `410` | (3 * 110) + 80 = 410 |
    | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0]` | `280` | Weekend: (8*10*2) + (4*15*2) = 280 |

    ### 💡 The Functional Logic
    This approach uses four distinct mathematical helpers:
    1. **sn:** Weekday Base (Hours * 10)
    2. **so:** Weekday Overtime (First 8 hours at 80 + remaining hours at 15)
    3. **wn:** Weekend Base (Double the normal rate)
    4. **wo:** Weekend Overtime (Double the weekday overtime rate)

    

    > **Mentor Tip:** Defining your rules as small functions (`sn`, `so`, etc.) is a pattern often seen in "Declarative Programming." It makes the core loop very easy to read because it looks like a simple decision tree.

    ### 🛡️ Guardrails
    - **Memory Efficiency:** By using a `total` accumulator instead of an intermediate array, we keep the space complexity at O(1).
    - **Logic Boundaries:** Using `i <= 4` strictly targets the first 5 elements. Always ensure your input array represents a full 7-day week to prevent logic errors.
    - **Security Hint:** In financial applications, floating-point math can lead to "penny errors." Since these are whole numbers, it's safe, but always be cautious if rates include decimals.
