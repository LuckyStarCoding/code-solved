In this challenge, you are given a date and you have to determine the correspondent season in a certain hemisphere of Earth.
You have to use the ranges given by the meteorological seasons definition, accordingly to the following table:

| Start | End | North Hemisphere | South Hemisphere |
|---|---|---|---|
| March, 1 | May, 31 | Spring | Autumn |
| June, 1 | August, 31 | Summer | Winter |
| September, 1 | November, 30 | Autumn | Spring |
| December, 1 | February, 28 | Winter | Summer |

Given two strings hemisphere (can be "N" for the North hemisphere or "S" for the South hemisphere) and date (name and day of the month), implement a function that returns a string with the season name, accordingly to the above table.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="examples" label="Examples" defaultValue>

* hemisphereSeason("N", "June, 30") ➞ "Summer"
* hemisphereSeason("N", "March, 1") ➞ "Spring"
* hemisphereSeason("S", "September, 22") ➞ "Spring"

    During leap years the end date of Winter in the northern hemisphere is the 29th day of February (last day of Summer in the southern hemisphere). 
    In this challenge, years are not used, so the last day of February will always be the 28th.

    
  📒  I spent some time working on this challenge, all because of an incorrectly selected data structure. Once I understood my mistake, I realized just how powerful the right data structure can be.

<TabItem value="solution" label="Solution" >
```jsx 
function hemisphereSeason(hemisphere, date) {
    const s = [{
    "months": ["March", "April", "May"],
    "north_hemisphere": "Spring",
    "south_hemisphere": "Autumn"
  },
  {
    "months": ["June", "July", "August"],
    "north_hemisphere": "Summer",
    "south_hemisphere": "Winter"
  },
  {
    "months": ["September", "October", "November"],
    "north_hemisphere": "Autumn",
    "south_hemisphere": "Spring"
  },
  {
    "months": ["January", "February", "December"],
    "north_hemisphere": "Winter",
    "south_hemisphere": "Summer"
  }
]

let i = s.indexOf(s.find(el=>el.months.includes(date.split(', ')[0])));
return hemisphere === 'N' ? s[i].north_hemisphere : s[i].south_hemisphere
}

```
