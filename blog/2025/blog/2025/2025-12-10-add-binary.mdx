Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

#### **Example 1: Short Strings with Carry**

* **Input: `a`** = `"11"`
* **Input: `b`** = `"1"`
* **Output** = `"100"`

**Explanation:** 11 (3 in decimal) plus 1 (1 in decimal) equals 100 (4 in decimal).

---

#### **Example 2: Longer Strings**

* **Input: `a`** = `"1010"`
* **Input: `b`** = `"1011"`
* **Output** = `"10101"`

**Explanation:** 1010 (10 in decimal) plus 1011 (11 in decimal) equals 10101 (21 in decimal).

   ## 🧠 Guidance: Adding Binary Strings

To approach adding two binary strings, the most effective way is to simulate **manual column-by-column addition** (just like you would with base-10 numbers), working from right to left.

---

### 🛠️ Algorithm Strategy

#### 1. Pointer Initialization
Start from the end of both strings using two pointers, `i` and `j`, representing the current digits being added.

#### 2. Handle the "Carry"
In binary addition, the carry is crucial:

* 0 + 0 = 0
* 1 + 0 = 1
* 1 + 1 = 0 (carry 1)
* 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 (carry 1)

You need a variable (usually called `carry`) to keep track of the remainder from the previous column.

#### 3. The Addition Loop
Run a loop while there are still digits to process in string `a`, string `b`, or a remaining `carry`.

* **Extract digits:** Convert the character at pointers `i` and `j` into integers. If a pointer goes out of bounds (one string is shorter than the other), treat that value as 0.
* **Calculate Sum:** `current_sum = digit_a + digit_b + carry`.
* **Update Carry:** `carry = floor(current_sum / 2)`.
* **Determine Digit:** The digit to append to your result is `current_sum % 2`.

#### 4. Build the Result
Since you are adding from right to left, the digits are found in reverse order. You can store them in an array or a string and reverse it at the end.

### 🧪 Example Walkthrough: `a = "11"`, `b = "1"`

1.  **Rightmost column:** 1 + 1 + 0 (carry) = 2.
    * Result digit: 0.
    * New carry: 1.
2.  **Next column:** 1 (from a) + 0 (empty b) + 1 (carry) = 2.
    * Result digit: 0.
    * New carry: 1.
3.  **Final carry:** The loop ends, but carry is still 1.
    * Append 1.
4.  **Reverse/Final Output:** `"100"`

    // Array to store the result digits (built in reverse order: least significant first)

    // Variable to track the carry-over to the next column
    let carry = 0;

    // Loop continues as long as there are digits left in either string 
    // OR if there is a remaining carry from the last addition.
    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry > 0) {
        
        // Extract digit from string 'a'. If index 'i' is out of bounds, treat the digit as 0.
        // The unary plus operator (+) converts the string character '0' or '1' to the number 0 or 1.
        let da = i >= 0 ? +a[i] : 0; 
        
        // Extract digit from string 'b'. If index 'j' is out of bounds, treat the digit as 0.
        let db = j >= 0 ? +b[j] : 0; 
        
        // Calculate the total sum for the current column (digit a + digit b + previous carry)
        let sum = da + db + carry;

        // The current result digit is the remainder (0 or 1) when sum is divided by 2 (sum % 2).
        res.push(sum % 2);

        // The new carry is the quotient (how many 2s fit into the sum) 
        // which is found using integer division (Math.floor(sum / 2)).
        carry = Math.floor(sum / 2);
        
        // Move pointers to the next column (leftward)
        i--;
        j--;
    }

    // The result array 'res' contains digits from right-to-left.
    // Reverse the array and join the elements to form the final binary string.
    return res.reverse().join('');
};

// Example usage is provided for context, but not part of the function definition itself.
// addBinary("1010", "1011")
