Every day, I'd sit down to work on my daily JavaScript task, and every day, the same scene would unfold.
I'd open my code editor and stare at a blank page, knowing I had to rebuild the same basic structure all over again.
It was a repetitive, boring chore that got in the way of what I actually wanted to do: solve the problem and write some cool code.

I was tired of this routine. I knew there had to be a better way to get to the fun part faster.
That's when it hit me: why not create a template to handle all the tedious setup? I decided to build a simple, reusable structure that would let me skip the boring part and jump straight into the challenge.
Here's how I did it.

You're absolutely encouraged to follow along! :smile:

To create a boilerplate MDX file for Docusaurus with front matter and other common parts, we'll need a script that automates the process.
Docusaurus itself doesn't have a built-in command for generating files from a template.
A simple Node.js or shell script is a common solution.

## 1. Create the Boilerplate Template

First, let's create a template file with the content that we'd want to include in every new MDX file. This template should include the standard Docusaurus front matter.
Create a new file named `template.mdx` in a convenient location (e.g., in a `scripts` directory at the root of the project) and add the boilerplate content:

```jsx
---
title: My New Document
description: A brief description of the document.
slug: /my-new-document
id: my-new-document
tags: [jstask, 2025]

# My New Document

This is the content of my new Docusaurus page.

```

Later, we can customize the front matter fields (title, description, slug, id, tags) and add any other standard content or components that we use regularly.

## 2. Create the Node.js Script

Next, let's create a simple Node.js script to read the template and create a new file with the user-provided name.
Create a new file named `create-mdx.js` in the same scripts directory.

```jsx
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// Get the desired file name from the command line arguments
const fileName = process.argv[2];

if (!fileName) {
  console.error("Please provide a file name for the new MDX file.");
  console.log("Usage: node create-mdx.js <file-name>");
  process.exit(1);
}

// Define the paths
const templatePath = path.join(__dirname, "template.mdx");
const outputPath = path.join(process.cwd(), "blog", `${fileName}.mdx`);

// Ensure the `docs` directory exists
const outputDir = path.dirname(outputPath);
if (!fs.existsSync(outputDir)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(outputDir, { recursive: true });
}

// Read the template content
const templateContent = fs.readFileSync(templatePath, "utf8");

// Write the content to the new file
fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, templateContent, "utf8");

console.log(`Successfully created a new MDX file at: ${outputPath}`);
```

### How the script works:

- It checks for a file name provided as a command-line argument.
- It defines the paths to the template and the new file (assuming your Docusaurus docs are in a docs folder).
- It ensures the destination directory exists.
- It reads the content of `template.mdx` and writes it to the new file.

## 3. Add an NPM Script

To make the process easy to use, let's add a script to the `package.json` file. This allows us to run the script with a simple command.
Open the `package.json` file and add the following line under the "scripts" section:

```jsx
"scripts": {
  "create-mdx": "node scripts/create-mdx.js",
  "start": "docusaurus start",
  "build": "docusaurus build",
  // ... other scripts
}

```

Now we can create a new MDX file with a single command from the terminal:

```jsx
npm run create-mdx my-new-page
```

This command will create a new file named `blog/my-new-page.mdx` with our boilerplate content, ready for us to fill in.

Done!
