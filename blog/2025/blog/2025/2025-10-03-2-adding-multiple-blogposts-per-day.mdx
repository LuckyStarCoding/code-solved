# 🚀 The Docusaurus Writer's Dilemma: Two Posts, One Day

Ever been on a serious writing streak? I sure have! I ran into a peculiar little snag recently when I needed to publish **two separate blog posts on the same calendar day** in my Docusaurus site.

Docusaurus is awesome, but it's *very* strict about using the date in your filename (`YYYY-MM-DD-...`) for post ordering. If two posts share the exact same date, the system gets confused about which one is "first."

Here's exactly how I fixed it, with two methods you can use! 👇

---

## 📅 Method 1: The Filename Identifier (The Quick Fix)

The simplest and most robust way to solve this is to add a small, **unique identifier** right after the date in your file name. This makes the filename unique while still keeping the primary date correct.

### Step-by-Step Filename Structure

By default, Docusaurus looks for: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug.md`.

To make it unique, we just sneak a sequential number (or letter) in there:

`{YYYY-MM-DD-X-your-slug.md}`

Where **`X`** is a number (1, 2, 3...) or a letter (A, B, C...) that dictates the order on that day.

| Filename | Publication Date | Order on Blog Roll |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `2025-10-02-1-morning-coffee-thoughts.md` | October 2, 2025 | 1st Post |
| `2025-10-02-2-afternoon-coding-tips.md` | October 2, 2025 | 2nd Post |
| `2025-10-02-3-late-night-ramblings.md` | October 2, 2025 | 3rd Post |

#### 📂 Example File Paths

If your blog posts live in the `blog/` directory, your structure would look like this:

```
blog/
├── 2025-10-02-1-morning-coffee-thoughts.md
├── 2025-10-02-2-afternoon-coding-tips.md
├── 2025-10-03-single-post-today.md
└── ...
```

## 🕰️ Method 2: Precise Time Control (The Clean Fix)

If you're like me and prefer to keep your filenames super clean, you can completely ignore the need for the sequential number in the file name and instead rely on the `date` field in your post's front matter.

If Docusaurus finds a `date` field in the front matter, it uses that instead of inferring the date from the filename! This gives you **explicit chronological control**.

### Step-by-Step Front Matter Structure

You need to use a precise **ISO 8601** string format, which includes the time and timezone (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`).

#### ☀️ File 1 (My Morning Post)

Let's publish this one at 10:00 AM UTC.

```markdown
---
slug: morning-update
title: My First Post of the Day
date: 2025-10-02T10:00:00Z  <-- The secret is the T10:00:00Z time!
---

Rise and shine! Some thoughts on today's tech news...

```

#### 🌙 File 2 (My Later Post)
This one goes out at 3:30 PM UTC.

```
---
slug: afternoon-update
title: My Second Post of the Day
date: 2025-10-02T15:30:00Z  <-- A later time ensures it's ordered correctly!
---
```

Alright, back from lunch with a new tutorial...
The beautiful result? Both posts will show up on the blog roll under October 2nd, but the 10:00 AM post will appear before the 3:30 PM post.

It's a small change, but it's a huge win for anyone trying to feed the content machine! Happy Docusaurus blogging! ✍️
